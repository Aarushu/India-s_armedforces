            <h1>Indian Army</h1>
            <h6>Indian Army comprises of three uniformed services – the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, and the Indian Airforce. The Indian army contributes to the security of the land, the Indian Navy contributes to the sea, and the Indian Airforce, according to its name, flies through the air. The History of the Indian army dates back to several millennia, but it is a history of brave incidents and a celebrated future. The first mention of armies was done in the epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata where the martial arts were generally known as ‘Dhanurveda’. We have since come a long way from what seems to be the start of the army culture. According to Global Firepower and considering world military strengths, The Indian army ranks 4th in the world in all aspects. Indian army finds its roots in 1776 as the ‘British Indian Army’.

            <h1>Indian Navy</h1>
            <h6>Indian Navy is a well-structured and disciplined branch, whose chief is called Admiral and President of India is the supreme commander of the Indian Navy. Indian navy has a very nice motto, which say’s “Sham No Varna”, which literally means “May the Lord of the Water be auspicious unto us”.
                The naval staff has a very nice blue and white color, showing the audacity and decent face of the Indian Navy. Even before the independence, there were many empires Chola, Yadav, etc. which tried to build the strong naval force.
                However, it was the Maratha Empire, founded by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, made a very strong naval force with the help of KanhojiAngre, to fight the foreign aggression.
                So, Shivaji Maharaj is known as the “Father of the Indian Navy”. After independence, India developed magnificent and disciplined Navy.
                The naval command of India is divided into four main commands, which are western, eastern, southern and northern.</h6>

            <h1>Indian Air Force (IAF)</h1>
            <h6>The Indian Air Force (IAF) is the air arm of the Indian Armed Forces. Its complement of personnel and aircraft assets ranks fourth amongst the air forces of the world.[11] Its primary mission is to secure Indian airspace and to conduct aerial warfare during armed conflict. It was officially established on 8 October 1932 as an auxiliary air force of the British Empire which honoured India's aviation service during World War II with the prefix Royal.[12] After India gained independence from United Kingdom in 1947, the name Royal Indian Air Force was kept and served in the name of Dominion of India. With the government's transition to a Republic in 1950, the prefix Royal was removed.

                Since 1950, the IAF has been involved in four wars with neighbouring Pakistan. Other major operations undertaken by the IAF include Operation Vijay, Operation Meghdoot, Operation Cactus and Operation Poomalai. The IAF's mission expands beyond engagement with hostile forces, with the IAF participating in United Nations peacekeeping missions.
                
                The President of India holds the rank of Supreme Commander of the IAF.[13] As of 1 July 2017, 1,39,576 personnel are in service with the Indian Air Force.[14][15] The Chief of the Air Staff, an air chief marshal, is a four-star officer and is responsible for the bulk of operational command of the Air Force. There is never more than one serving ACM at any given time in the IAF. The rank of Marshal of the Air Force has been conferred by the President of India on one occasion in history, to Arjan Singh. On 26 January 2002, Singh became the first and so far, only five-star rank officer of the IAF.[16]

                1933–1942
                1942–1945
                1947–1950
                1950 – present
                
                Indian Air Force flag at India Gate, New Delhi
                The IAF's mission is defined by the Armed Forces Act of 1947, the Constitution of India, and the Air Force Act of 1950.[18] It decrees that in the aerial battlespace:
                
                Defence of India and every part there of including preparation for defence and all such acts as may be conducive in times of war to its prosecution and after its termination to effective demobilisation.
                
                In practice, this is taken as a directive meaning the IAF bears the responsibility of safeguarding Indian airspace and thus furthering national interests in conjunction with the other branches of the armed forces. The IAF provides close air support to the Indian Army troops on the battlefield as well as strategic and tactical airlift capabilities. The Integrated Space Cell is operated by the Indian Armed Forces, the civilian Department of Space, and the Indian Space Research Organisation. By uniting the civilian run space exploration organisations and the military faculty under a single Integrated Space Cell the military is able to efficiently benefit from innovation in the civilian sector of space exploration, and the civilian departments benefit as well.[clarification needed][19][20]
                
                The Indian Air Force, with highly trained crews, pilots, and access to modern military assets provides India with the capacity to provide rapid response evacuation, search-and-rescue (SAR) operations, and delivery of relief supplies to affected areas via cargo aircraft.[21] The IAF provided extensive assistance to relief operations during natural calamities such as the Gujarat cyclone in 1998, the tsunami in 2004, and North India floods in 2013.[21] The IAF has also undertaken relief missions such as Operation Rainbow in Sri Lanka.[21]</h6>
